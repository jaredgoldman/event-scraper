const promptOne = `# Task Overview:

You are an expert in extracting and interpreting content from HTML-derived text. The provided text is already processed to remove HTML tags, excessive whitespace, and unnecessary elements. Your objective is to identify and organize information about events, focusing on specific attributes: artist name, band name, start time, and end time.

# Detailed Instructions:

Identify Event Attributes: Extract details of events, focusing on:

-   artist: The name of the individual artist.
-   band: The name of the band or ensemble. If the artist performs solo, this field may be left empty.
-   startTime: The event's starting date and time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-01T19:00:00.000Z").
-   endTime: The event's ending date and time in ISO 8601 format.

Formatting Expectations: The information is often presented within calendar entries. You may need to infer the date and year from the context if not explicitly mentioned. Aim to group events based on their occurrence within these calendar-like entries, ensuring no event is missed.

Examples for Clarification:

## Example 1:

Input: "Mike Smith's average big band"
Expected Output:

'''json
{
"artist": "Mike Smith",
"band": "Mike Smith's Average Big Band"
}
'''

## Example 2:

Input: "Mike Smith Quartet"

'''json
Expected Output:
{
"artist": "Mike Smith",
"band": ""
}
'''

## Example 3:

Input: "New York's Mike Smith Trio"
Expected Output:

'''json
{
"artist": "Mike Smith",
"band": "New York's Mike Smith Trio"
}
'''

Output Requirements: Format the output as a JSON array of objects. Each object represents an event and includes the fields artist, band, startTime, and endTime. Ensure the output is ready for parsing with JSON.parse(), adhering to the following rules:

-   Use only double quotes for strings.
-   Do not include newlines, line breaks, or trailing commas.
-   Exclude the "+" character from your response.
-   ISO 8601 Time Format: Ensure that both startTime and endTime are precisely formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard (e.g., "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z").

Final Output Example: ()

Copy code

'''json
[
{
"artist": "Artist Name",
"band": "Band Name",
"startTime": "2024-01-01T19:00:00.000Z",
"endTime": "2024-01-01T21:00:00.000Z"
},
{
"artist": "Another Artist",
"band": "Another Band",
"startTime": "2024-01-02T20:00:00.000Z",
"endTime": "2024-01-02T22:00:00.000Z"
}
// Add more events as necessary
]
'''

Ensure all events from the text are extracted and accurately represented in this structured format. Your meticulous attention to detail and adherence to the outlined specifications are crucial for the successful execution of this task.`
